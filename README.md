# 🎵 Mobile-First Music Player (V2)
A high-performance, touch-optimized music player built for the modern mobile web.

## 📱 The Evolution (V1 vs V2)
After building my initial [Universal Player](https://github.com/CodeWithKhofi/player), I realized that mobile users require a more specific UX. 
- **V1:** Focused on desktop/mobile cross-compatibility.
- **V2 (This Repo):** Optimized specifically for mobile viewports, touch-gestures, and efficient asset loading.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Mobile-Optimized UI:** Designed specifically for portrait orientation and thumb-reachability.
- **Clean State Management:** Handles track switching and progress tracking with Vanilla JS.
- **Responsive Media Controls:** Large touch targets for play/pause.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Flexbox)
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Architecture:** Mobile-First Design Principles

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/music-list`: Contains the audio track logic (MP3s excluded via `.gitignore`).
- `/covers`: Song artwork and visual assets(excluded via `.gitignore`).
- `pro.js`: The core logic engine for the player.

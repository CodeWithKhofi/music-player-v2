1. Create audio object
2. Create song list
3. Track current song index
4. loadSong(index) → prepares the song
5. playSong() → plays the audio
6. pauseSong() → pauses the audio
7. nextSong() → change index → load → play
8. previousSong() → change index → load → play






Creat the audio object 
    const audio = new Audio()



1.Create song object. allSongs = [{
    id: //song number,
    title:song title,
    artiste:artiste name,
    src: location of the song file,
    cover: clocation of the song cover
}]

2.Create a variable to access song number
  let currentSongNumber = 0

3.A function to load the allSongs
    function loadSong(index){
        const song = allSongs[index]
        title.textContent = song.title
        artiste.textContent = song.artiste
        audio.src = song.src
        cover.src = song.cover
    }

4. A function to play song
    function playSong(){
        audio.play()
        change button states
        
    }

5. A function to pause song
    function pauseSong(){
        audio.pause()
        change button states
    }

6. A function to play next song
    function nextSong(){
        currentSongNumber ++
        //check if song has ended if(currentSongNumber >= allSongs.length){
                                        currentSongNumber = 0
        }
        call load song function
        call playSong function
    }

7. A function to play previous song
    function previousSong(){
        currentSongNumber --
        //check if previous song is <0 if(currentSongNumber < 0){
            currentSongNumber = allSongs.length - 1.//loop back
        }
        call load song function
        call playSong function
    }

8. Auto play when one song ends
    Listen for ended on audio and call next song function

9. A function to toggle play/pause
    function togglePlay(){
        if audio is paused, call play function else call pause function
    }
